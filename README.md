# Obsidian Incremental Writing Plugin

This plugin allows you to do incremental writing in Obsidian. Notes and blocks can be added to queues that will schedule reviews of your writing over time.

## Using the plugin

NOTE: If you are using Vim mode, adding a block to the queue must be done with a hotkey because using ctrl+p to open the command palette causes the cursor to move up a line.

If you have installed the nldates plugin, you can use natural language when you are asked to provide a date eg. "tomorrow" or "in two weeks".

There are currently 10 hotkey / command palette commands and a couple of buttons and context menu commands.

1. Load a queue: The plugin supports multiple queues that you can switch between using a fuzzy search menu. The fuzzy menu searches in the queue folder specified in the settings.
2. Open queue in current pane: Open the currently loaded queue in the current pane. Toggle to preview mode to see it formatted correctly.
3. Open queue in new pane: Open the currently loaded queue in a new pane. Toggle to preview mode to see it formatted correctly.
4. Add note to queue: Adds the current note to the current incremental writing queue.
5. Add block to queue: Adds the current block to the current incremental writing queue.
6. Current repetition: Goes to the current repetition for the loaded queue.
7. Next repetition: Goes to the next repetition for the loaded queue.
8. Dismiss current repetition: Dismiss the current repetition from the queue. This note or block will not show up again for review.
9. Add links within the current note to a queue: Add any links to other notes within the current note to a queue.
10. Add note to queue through a fuzzy finder

You can also add the output from an inbuilt search to a queue. Do a search and click the button at the top of the search pane to try it out.

You can also right click on folders, files and links to add them to queues through the context menu.
